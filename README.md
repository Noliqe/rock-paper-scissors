# rock-paper-scissors

This project contains a rock-paper-scissors game!

> Project works now with html/css and javascript using buttons instead of browser prompt.


What I've learned by doing this project:

- Learned how to connect html class/id to javascript. (DOM methods)
- How to change text input using javascript.
- How to use style using javascript.
- Learned that if something is wrong, It's the code.
